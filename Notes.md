## **3. Fundamental Concepts of Data Visualization**

In terms of the data visualization task, it is crucial to understand the data set you have, type of variables and which data viz representations are suitable for the succesful data story telling. Beyond these details, it is a very design-oriented process from the design perspective to avoid any harm on human sight or perception. Rather than manipulating what the raw data says by its nature, the designer should stick to the certain design choices based on the problem and data set. For this purpose, this section collects and gathers various related ideas and details to investigate the necessity of data visualization for data communication and specific principles alongside the effective and responsible data visualization practices.

### 3.1 What is Data Visulization, Why Do We Need to Visualize?

As human begins we are generally both good and bad in terms of seeing inherited patterns, spot anomalies, generate questions from them when they look at any specific data viz case. Generally, the purpose is to literally *see* what your data seems to say. This framework allows to communicate findings clearly and persuasively with audience under the pre-specified design choices that we are making accordingly. Especially, for the data analysis workflow, to understand data and ask relevant research questions, this exploration, known as Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), plays a crucial role from beginning to end, for identyfing the relevant rabbit hole to dive in and any possible refinement of the analysis for later stages. In a different way, EDA is the first step in **understanding** the main features and structures of a data set, this brings us doing specific data visualization type choices and as such. There are many statistical tools and techniques are used when performing EDA, but crucially they are **simple** to allow the data __speak__ for itself, including but not limited to the list of (i) Data transformation/wrangling, (ii) Calculation of simple summary statistics (mean, median, variance, correlation, etc.) and (iii) tabulation, graphical or visual representations. From that point of view, to investigate our toolkit in an efficient way, it is better to focus on the concept of graphical or visual representations in depth.
